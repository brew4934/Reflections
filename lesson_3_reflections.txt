When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
You would greatly benefit from a remote repo when multiple people are collaborating on the same project.  Also, it is helpful
when you must access the same code from multiple machines, or if you must be able to show code to another person when you're
not at your computer.
